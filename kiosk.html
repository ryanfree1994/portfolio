<div style="margin: 20px;">
      <p>As I am passionate about social impact design, I took a class on Interaction Design at the University of Michigan. Through standard UX research and design methodology, I designed a public kiosk interface that educates the public about the violence targeted against LGBTQ+ folx. I followed a participatory and iterative design approach to create and evaluate my public kiosk interface. </p>
      <p>My research began by completing a literature review, conducting and analyzing interviews, as well as disseminating and evaluating a survey. This research provided me with the base foundation of my potential users, non-users, as well as extreme-case users, which were translated into personas/scenarios and use cases. Initially, my ideas for this technological intervention were similar to self-reporting applications and websites, in which LGBTQ+ folx would report places in which they had experienced hate crimes, so that the community could respond and ensure safer spaces were established. </p>
      <p>While the LGBTQ+ community is disproportionately affected by violence as compared to non-LGBTQ+ individuals, it is not the responsibility of LGBTQ+ folx to continuously advocate and educate non-LGBTQ+ folx about this issue. With this in mind, my research, sketching, and brainstorming with end users secured the idea of a public kiosk that would allow for the community to become better allies to the LGBTQ+ community by educating themselves on how to become better allies. Though my work was iterative, I applied the following methodologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Literature Reviews</li>
      <li>Interviewing</li>
      <li>Qualitative Analysis</li>
      <li>Affinity Diagramming</li>
      <li>Personas/Scenarios</li>
      <li>Storyboarding</li>
      <li>Sketching</li>
      <li>Brainstorming</li>
      <li>Wireframing</li>
      <li>Lo-fi Prototyping</li>
      <li>Hi-fi Prototyping (Sketch & InVision)</li>
      <li>Usability Testing (Remote & In-Person)</li>
    </ul>
