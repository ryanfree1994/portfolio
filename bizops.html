    <p>During my final semester of graduate studies, I enrolled in a course through the <a id="hyperlink" href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/" target="_blank" alt="Link to University of Michigan's Ross School of Business">University of Michigan Ross School of Business</a> in which we partnered with international organizations to assist in evaluating their business operations. My team worked with "LiveWell," an institute for rehabilitation medicine, in Hyderabad, India to understand ways in which they could improve their internal and external processes.</p>
    <p>My team worked with LiveWell to understand what research questions they wanted to discover, which allowed us to develop interview guides and observation tools to use during our site visit in March 2018. During our visit, we conducted approximately eight interviews with internal staff, as well as five interviews with external stakeholders/subject matter experts. Additionally, we completed daily observations over the course of our five day site visit.</p>
    <p>During analysis of our interviews, my team performed qualitative analyses and affinity diagramming to identify our key findings and recommendations. Due to a few gaps in our knowledge of rehabilitation centers, we also conducted a literature review of rehabilitation center best practices for client-patient relationships. Finally, my team and I compiled a formal report and presentation that outlined our methodology and key findings/recommendations. We applied the following skills to uncover our findings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Observational Research</li>
      <li>Interviewing</li>
      <li>Qualitative Analysis</li>
      <li>Affinity Diagramming</li>
      <li>Literative Review</li>
      <li>Task Analysis</li>
      <li>Workflow Mapping</li>
    </ul>
