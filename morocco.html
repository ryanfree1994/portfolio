<div style="margin: 20px;">
      <p>During the summer of 2017, I completed my Master of Health Informatics internship in Morocco. I assisted in training students on UX research methodology, evaluating an NGO's website via UX evaluation (heuristics evaluation and interaction mapping), as well as UX research preparation for a mHealth mobile application that provided pregnancy-related information to its priority users.</p>
      <p>When I was in Morocco, I interned under the supervision of <a id="hyperlink" href="https://fsph.iupui.edu/about/directory/turman-jack.html" target="_blank" alt="Link to Dr. Jack Turman, Jr.'s profile at Indiana State University'">Dr. Jack Turman, Jr</a>. Through his coordination, I worked with Dr. Idriss Alaoui at Al Hayat Chaïnes de Vie in Rabat, Morocco, where I assisted in evaluating his NGO's website, as well as the impact of his midwifery training program. Specifically, the research team wanted to understand whether or not the organization's midwifery training program reduced the number of maternal and infant mortalities and if the midwives retained the knowledge acquired from the trainings one year post-training. In order to answer this question, we developed a survey questionnaire tool that measured knowledge retention. The tool was created with the midwives and pilot tested through a sample of midwives from Rabat and surrounding cities. After pilot testing the tool, the questionnaire was submitted to the Moroccan Ministry of Health, where it is still under review. The following skills were applied during my internship:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Literature Reviews</li>
        <li>Interviewing</li>
        <li>Program Design & Evaluation</li>
        <li>Interaction Mapping</li>
        <li>Heuristics Evaluation</li>
        <li>Usabilty Testing</li>
        <li>Survey Construction</li>
        <li>UX Analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Simultaneously, I worked at <a id="hyperlink" href="http://www.uh1.ac.ma/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Hassan First University's website">Hassan Premier 1er</a> in Settat, Morocco, where I developed and taught a course on the Global Social Determinants of Health, as well as trained students on UX evaluation for mobile applications. The course was a six-week class in which students worked with each other to understand the social determinants that affect health outcomes within specific countries. At the end of the course, the students hypothesized interventions that would address a specific social determinant to decrease poor health outcomes. Overall, 25 students completed the course and received high marks on their final grades.</p>
      <p>When I wasn't teaching, I was working with a student group that had created a mobile application focused on providing pregnancy-related information to its end users. As the app was due for deployment and had not yet been evaluated, I had been asked to train students on UX analysis for mobile apps, with specific focus on surveys and usability testing. The students and I established a survey and usability test script - with scenarios - which were used to test the application and refine its content and navigation.</p>
      <p>While my time in Morocco ended prior to the publication of the website and app, I have been told that both technological solutions are published and available via Android. If you would like access to these solutions, please reach out via the <a id="hyperlink" href="contact.html" alt="Link to Contact page on Ryan Freeland's portfolio">Contact page</a>. While similar skills were applied in both internships, the following UX methods were used throughout the mobile app evaluation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Program Design & Evaluation</li>
      <li>Personas/Scenarios</li>
      <li>App Development</li>
      <li>Heuristics Evaluation</li>
      <li>Usabilty Testing</li>
      <li>Survey Construction</li>
      <li>Training</li>
      <li>UX Analysis</li>
    </ul>
